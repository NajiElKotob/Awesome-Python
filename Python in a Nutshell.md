# Python in a Nutshell

- Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Created in the early 1990s.
- Variables hold data in memory. They have names, and they can be referenced by name. 
- Python is a dynamically typed language, which means the variable type is determined by the data assigned to it.
- Many types are nothing more than specialized versions of more general types. Integers are a subset of floating point numbers, and Booleans are a subset of integers.
- Strings can be added to other strings (an operation known as "concatenation") with the same + operator that adds two numbers.
- Python supports comments using the pound sign (or hash) followed by the text of the comment
- input function reads what the user types on the keyboard and returns it as a string eg name = input('Enter your name:')
